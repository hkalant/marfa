[The Verge:](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17277360/gmail-redesign-live-features-google-update)
> The worldâ€™s most popular email service is getting a big overhaul today. Google is making official the changes we saw leaked earlier this month, with email snoozing, nudging, and confidential mode making their debut alongside a substantial visual redesign for Gmail on the web.

Not a fan of the redesign, but the new features are welcome. Its design seems inconsistent if you ask me, which is [not surprising](https://pxlnv.com/linklog/google-tasks/). Needless to say that Inbox, which introduced some of those a few years ago, might be going away in the future.
