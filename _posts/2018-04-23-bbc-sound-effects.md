BBC released an archive of [16,013 sounds effects](http://bbcsfx.acropolis.org.uk/) for personal, educational or research purposes, which means that I will spend the whole day today going through these. They were released under the RemArc Licence which is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/bbcarchdev/Remarc/blob/master/doc/2016.09.27_RemArc_Content%20licence_Terms%20of%20Use_final.pdf). This means that they cannot be used for commercial purposes and a credit is required.
