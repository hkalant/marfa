In this [article from Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/why-zuckerberg-15-year-apology-tour-hasnt-fixed-facebook/), Zeynep Tufekci counts the times Mark Zuckerberg has apologised for his company's misconduct on [data privacy issues](https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-a-history-of-mark-zuckerberg-apologizing/) instead of fixing his platform. In fact the first time he apologised was before he found Facebook.

Unfortunately, I see this as an underlying issue of the Anglo culture in general. Since I moved to the UK, I realised that people tend to apologise way too many times, even when it is not really necessary.

Yes, people are trying not be rude, but some seem to think that by apologising they can get away with everything.
