In the spirit of [Derek Siverâ€™s Now page](https://nownownow.com/about), here is what I am up to at the moment:

- I currently live in Oxford, United Kingdom.
- I work for [Digital Services](https://www.brookes.ac.uk/learning-resources/digital-services-and-learning-technology/) at Oxford Brookes University.
- I am heavily involved in a project regarding Digital Capabilities for academic staff.
- I am building a website to store support materials that can help staff with learning technology in Oxford Brookes.
- I am learning to build online courses with [Evolve](http://evolveauthoring.com/).
- I am slowly building this very portfolio.
- I am currently reading: *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind* by Yuval Noah Harari.
